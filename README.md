The Nitrogen Decision Support Tool (NDST) was created at the Universit of Wisconsin, Madison for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to aid in
decision making pertaining to the support of nitrogen fertilizer regulations. The goal is to assess the impacts of varied agricultural land management 
(e.g., crop type and rotation, N fertilizer rates, irrigation) and weather variability across the upper Midwest USA on N losses to the environment, witih a focus
on nitrate leaching into the groundwater system. 

The data displayed in the tool were simulated in the Agro-IBIS agroecosystem model, which has been developed at UW-Madison over the past 20 years and is published in peer-reviewed literature. 

Users of the NDST can specify a location by clicking on the map, and visualize and download corn yield, nitrate leaching and nitrate concentration responses to varying N fertilizer application rates.
